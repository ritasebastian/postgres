### **Frequent Alerts or Tasks for PostgreSQL Instance Recovery**

#### **Enhance Automatic Recovery Mechanisms**
1. **Identify the Root Cause:**  
   Diagnose the issue before starting the recovery process.

2. **Check for Active Backup Processes:**  
   - Stop any active backup processes.  
   - Comment out the backup process temporarily until recovery is completed.

3. **Verify Last Successful Backup:**  
   - If the last backup is outdated, address the issue to prevent future risks.

4. **Ensure No WAL File Mismatches:**  
   - Avoid incomplete restoration by ensuring proper WAL file synchronization.

5. **Cluster-Wide Health Maintenance:**  
   - Resolve similar issues in other instances to ensure overall cluster stability.

### **Frequent 100% Data Directory Disk Space Alerts in PostgreSQL**

#### **Causes**
1. **WAL Files Filling Up:**  
   - Frequent backup failures cause accumulation.  
   - Delayed WAL archiving due to unresponsive backup storage.

2. **Temporary Files Filling Up:**  
   - Inefficient or long-running queries generate large temporary files.

#### **Mitigation Steps**
1. **Resolve Backup Failures:**  
   - Investigate and resolve issues like connection failures or storage unavailability.  
   - Increase WAL file archiving frequency using `archive_timeout`.  
   - Monitor backup processes and set up failure alerts.

2. **Address Temporary File Issues:**  
   - Optimize queries by adding indexes or avoiding large intermediate results.  
   - Adjust `work_mem` and `temp_file_limit` settings.  
   - Identify and terminate long-running resource-heavy queries.  
   - Use `log_temp_files` to track large temporary files.

### **Resolving SQL Monitoring and Performance Issues with AppDynamics (AppD)**

#### **Common Client Requests**
1. Access to full SQL queries for debugging or optimization.  
2. Identification of long-running SQL queries.  
3. CPU load analysis for resource-intensive queries.  
4. Diagnosis of timeout issues.

#### **Solution: Train Clients on AppD**
1. **Benefits for Clients:**  
   - SQL Query Insights: View detailed execution plans and metrics.  
   - Long-Running Query Identification: Proactively optimize performance.  
   - CPU and Resource Monitoring: Understand resource usage.  
   - Timeout Diagnosis: Identify bottlenecks causing timeouts.

2. **Training Topics:**  
   - Navigating AppDâ€™s interface for monitoring and analysis.  
   - Setting up alerts for performance thresholds.  
   - Using dashboards for trend analysis.  
   - Steps for self-service troubleshooting.

### **Issue: Hardcoded DB Server Names in Deployments**

#### **Problem Statement:**  
Hardcoding server names leads to connections to standby instances, causing errors and data inconsistencies.

#### **Root Causes:**
1. Directly specifying primary or standby servers instead of using the load balancer.  
2. Lack of dynamic routing for writable instances.  
3. Limited understanding of PostgreSQL high availability.

#### **Mitigation Plan:**
1. **Educate Clients on Best Practices:**  
   - Train on PostgreSQL architecture and load balancer usage.  
   - Highlight risks such as downtime, data inconsistencies, and maintenance overhead.

2. **Enforce Load Balancer Usage:**  
   - Mandate load balancer endpoints in all configurations.

### **Resolving Timeout and DB Server Responsiveness Issues**

#### **Problem Statement:**  
Clients face timeouts or unresponsive databases due to load balancer or network issues.

#### **Root Causes:**
1. Load balancer misconfigurations or missing health checks.  
2. Network issues like latency or packet loss.  
3. Lack of client knowledge to troubleshoot independently.

#### **Mitigation Plan:**
1. **Train Clients on Internal Tools:**  
   - Provide access and guidance for monitoring load balancer health.

2. **Standard Troubleshooting Steps:**  
   - Verify load balancer status using internal tools.  
   - Check network connectivity with `ping` or `traceroute`.  
   - Ensure timeout settings align across all configurations.

3. **Proactive Communication:**  
   - Notify clients about known issues with automated alerts.  
   - Share real-time dashboards for system health.

#### **Training Modules:**  
1. Understanding load balancer functionality.  
2. Using internal health-check tools.  
3. Best practices for connectivity and escalation protocols.

## 🔁 What is MVCC in PostgreSQL?

**MVCC** stands for **Multi-Version Concurrency Control**.  
It is a feature in PostgreSQL that helps many users access the database at the same time **without waiting or blocking each other**.

### 💡 Why is MVCC important?

In a database, when one person is reading data and another person is writing (updating) the same data, it can cause **conflicts** or make people wait.  
MVCC solves this by giving each user a **"snapshot"** of the data — like a copy of what the data looked like when they started their work.

### 📦 How does it work?

Let’s say:
- Transaction A starts and reads a row.
- At the same time, Transaction B updates that same row.

PostgreSQL does **not** overwrite the row. Instead, it:
- Keeps the **old row** for Transaction A to read
- Creates a **new version** of the row for Transaction B

So:
- Readers see the old version.
- Writers work with the new version.
- **No one blocks anyone else.**

### 🧠 What’s stored in each row?

Every row in a PostgreSQL table has:
- `xmin`: ID of the transaction that created it.
- `xmax`: ID of the transaction that deleted or updated it.

These help PostgreSQL decide which row version to show to each transaction.

### 🧹 What happens to old rows?

When rows are no longer needed (because all users have finished using them), PostgreSQL runs a process called **VACUUM** to clean them up and free space.

### ✅ Benefits of MVCC

| Feature | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| No waiting | Readers don’t block writers, and writers don’t block readers. |
| Safe reads | Everyone sees consistent and correct data. |
| Fast performance | Many users can work at the same time efficiently. |
| No dirty reads | A transaction will never see data that hasn’t been committed yet. |

---

### 🧪 Example

1. **User A** starts a transaction and reads data from a table.
2. **User B** updates that data and commits the change.
3. **User A** still sees the old data — because they are looking at their own snapshot.
4. After User A finishes, future queries will see the updated data.
